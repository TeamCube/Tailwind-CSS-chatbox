# Tailwind-CSS-chatbox
A **working chat box** where you can **send messages** but they wont respond, it will just send the text that you inputted.

First, type in anything in the input box.

Like I said, they **won't respond** but you can only send messages.

Then send the message by clicking the arrow button beside the microphone near the input box.

And there you go! You sent a message!

This is created with Tailwind CSS.
I'm not really good at programming yet but I hope you liked it!
